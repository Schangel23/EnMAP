    "## Session Cookie Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "To download data from the EOC Geoservice using `curl`, you must first obtain the session cookie from the EOC Geoservice UMS. Follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access the Login Page**: Open the following link in your browser: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   [EO-LAB (ENMAP) Login](https://sso.eoc.dlr.de/eoc/auth/login?service=https://download.geoservice.dlr.de/ENMAP/files/L2A/)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   On the right side under **External Identity Providers**, click **EO-LAB (ENMAP)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Log in**: Enter your EO-Lab credentials when prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Open Developer Tools**: Press **F12** (or open your browser's Web Developer Tools). If you miss it, refresh the page with **F5**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Locate the GET Request**: In the **Network** tab, look for a GET request resembling the following URL:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `https://download.geoservice.dlr.de/ENMAP/files/L2A/?ticket=ST-11848-nWxfdPAbhjmUoQdgPeS8uTr-gps-auth`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Copy the cURL Command**: Right-click on that request and select **Copy as cURL**. The exact command you copy does not matterâ€”the code handles both POSIX and Windows environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Update the Notebook**: Replace the example `CURL_COMMAND` in the user configuration cell with your own cURL command containing your session cookie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Session cookies expire over time. For long downloads or additional files, repeat this procedure to obtain a new session cookie."
